# Scroll-to-everything

## Add anchors and use a smooth scrolling animation for a better user experience.

Do you write longer text in posts or pages and want to provide your website visitors links to skip parts?

Usually this is done by adding HTML anchors manually. But not everyone feels happy using the editor in text mode and writing HTML code can be error-prone.

This plugin places a new anchor icon in your editor toolbar. To place an anchor, click in your text, then click the anchor icon and fill in a short name (e.g. `summmary`) to create a new anchor.

Now you can link to this anchor from other sections of your webpage. You can use the link icon provided to add regular links to other webpages, but as URL you only add a hash sign followed by the name of the anchor (e.g. `#summary`). Thatâ€™s about it. If a visitors of your website now clicks on that link in the front end, the web page will smoothly scroll to the selected anchor.

The animation is too fast or too slow? Under **Settings > Reading** you can select the speed or even disable the animation at all.

You can also set an **offset** for anchors, which comes handy if you e.g. use a fixed header.

Finally, there is a setting whether anchors should be **displayed front end** with an anchor or be hidden entirely.
