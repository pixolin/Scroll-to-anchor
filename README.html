<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Do you write longer text in posts or pages and want to provide links to skip parts?</p>

<p>Usually this is done by adding HTML anchors in the text editor as link targets. But not everyone feels happy writing HTML code, which also may be error-prone. After installing this plugin you can use the new anchor icon in your visual editor toolbar to place anchors.</p>

<p>Click in your text where you want to place the anchor, then click on the anchor icon. A dialog box appears where you can provide a short name for your anchor (e.g. &#8220;summary&#8221;). Optionally you may also provide CSS class name to individually style the anchor. As a result, a shortcode will be placed into your text. This shortcode will render according to your settings and get replaced in the front end with the correct HTML.</p>

<p>Next you can create a link to this anchor. Write some Text (e.g. &#8220;Skip to summary&#8221;), mark the text and use the default link icon in the editor toolbar. Instead of the complete URL it is sufficient to provide the previously created anchor name, preceded by a hash sign (e.g. &#8220;#summary&#8221;). That’s about it. If a visitors of your website now clicks on that link in the front end, they will see the web page scrolling smoothly to the defined anchor.</p>

<h3 id="individualsettings">Individual Settings</h3>

<p>This plugin provides some enhancement only, so it doesn&#8217;t come with yet another settings page but instead adds a settings section to the menu <strong>Settings &gt; Reading</strong>.</p>

<p>Here you can select the speed of the scrolling animation or even disable the animation entirely.</p>

<p>You can also set an <strong>offset</strong> for anchors, which comes handy if you e.g. use a fixed header.</p>

<p>Some users just want the smooth scrolling effect, but don&#8217;t want any text to show up in their posts or pages. Therefore the plugin won&#8217;t display anything in the front end unless you choose differently in the settings. Those who want to show the anchors as text, may choose their own label for anchors, e.g. &#8220;footnote&#8221; or &#8220;section&#8221; (followed by the name you chose for that particular anchor).</p>

<p>I appreciate all feedback.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>You can install <strong>Scroll to Anchor</strong> automatically from the plugin directory, or by uploading the files manually to your server. After activating <strong>Scroll to Anchor</strong> you&#8217;ll be forwarded to the settings section at the bottom of the menu <strong>Settings &gt; Reading</strong>.</p>

<p>To uninstall, just deactivate and delete the plugin. Remember to remove the shortcodes you may have added using the plugin.</p>

<h3 id="frequentlyaskedquestions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p>Q: Why don&#8217;t I see any settings page?
There is no need to add yet another settings page. You&#8217;ll find the plugin settings at <strong>Settings &gt; Reading</strong>.</p>

<p>Q: Are there any restrictions for anchor names?
The plugin skips anchor links starting with <code>#respond</code> (usually comments) and on pages with a body-class <code>.woocommerce</code> anchors starting with <code>#tab</code> to avoid conflicts with WooCommerce&#8217;s product tabs.</p>
