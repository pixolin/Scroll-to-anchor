<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Do you write longer text in posts or pages and want to provide links to skip parts?</p>

<p>Usually this is done by adding HTML anchors in the text editor as link targets. But not everyone feels happy writing HTML code, which also may be error-prone. Instead you can now use the new anchor icon in your visual editor toolbar to place anchors.</p>

<p>Click in your text where you want to place the anchor, then click the anchor icon. A dialog box appears where you can provide a short name for your anchor (e.g. &#8220;summary&#8221;) and optionally give the anchor a CSS class name for individual styling. As a result, a shortcode will be placed into your text, which will then get replaced in the front end with the correct HTML.</p>

<p>Next you can create a link to this anchor at another section of your text. Write some Text (e.g. &#8220;Skip to summary&#8221;), mark the text and use the default link icon in the editor toolbar. Instead of the complete URL it is sufficient if you provide the anchor name, preceded by a hash sign (e.g. &#8220;#summary&#8221;). That’s about it. If a visitors of your website now clicks on that link in the front end, they will see the web page scrolling smoothly to the defined anchor.</p>

<p>Is the animation too fast or too slow? Under <strong>Settings &gt; Reading</strong> you can select the speed or even disable the animation.</p>

<p>You can also set an <strong>offset</strong> for anchors, which comes handy if you e.g. use a fixed header.</p>

<p>How do you want the anchor to be displayed? By default the anchor will be displayed as &#8220;Anchor: …&#8221; but you can chose any term you like, e.g. &#8220;Label: …&#8221;. If you rather don&#8217;t want to show the anchor at all, just uncheck the check box underneath.</p>
